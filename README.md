# 🛡️ Claim Risk Profiler: Detecting Fraudulent Insurance Claims

This project explores a small sample of auto insurance claims to detect patterns behind fraudulent reports.

## 🧠 Objectives
- Explore claim behavior and highlight fraud-related patterns
- Train a simple classification model to flag suspicious claims
- Demonstrate how data can support fraud investigation and insurance decisions

## 📊 Tools Used
- Python (Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib)
- Scikit-learn (Logistic Regression, evaluation metrics)
- Google Colab

## 📌 Key Insights
- Fraud was more frequent in 'Total Loss' and 'Major Damage' claims
- Higher total claim amounts often had stronger fraud links
- Fault by policyholder slightly increased fraud tendency

## 🔍 Model Performance
Logistic Regression model trained and tested on synthetic data  
Achieved a basic classification result with potential for improvement on larger data
